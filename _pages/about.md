My name is Amit Lale. I'm a programmer, technology enthusiast and a reader. I work out of Redmond, Washingto. This blog, its content and opinions are my own. I blog about technology, gadgets, code, health and many things in between, that pique my interest . I publish articles here on this blog and also on other blogging platforms like [Medium](https://medium.com/@amit.lale).
